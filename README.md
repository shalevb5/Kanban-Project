# Kanban Board Application

Final project for **Software Engineering 101 (Spring 2025)**.  
This project implements a **Kanban board with a graphical user interface (GUI)**, allowing users to manage tasks visually across different workflow stages.

## Features
- Create, edit, and delete tasks.  
- Move tasks between workflow columns (e.g., *To Do → In Progress → Done*).  
- Persistent data storage (tasks saved between sessions).  
- Intuitive GUI with drag-and-drop support.  
- Clear separation of concerns: business logic vs. presentation (follows SE best practices).
